        question: "You want a 1BHK in Koramangala 5th Block. What is the realistic minimum rent you should expect to pay in early 2026?",
        options: { "A": "₹15,000", "B": "₹22,000", "C": "₹32,000", "D": "₹45,000" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "A 1BHK in Koramangala 5th Block typically runs ₹32,000–38,000 in 2026. The jump from 4th to 5th Block alone adds a premium purely on perceived social cachet and proximity to cafes."

        question: "Under the 2025 Home Rent Rules, security deposits are legally capped at 2 months. However, what is the entrenched market reality you'll likely still face in prime IT corridors?",
        options: { "A": "Strictly 2 months", "B": "First and last month only", "C": "5 to 10 months rent", "D": "No deposit, just a guarantor" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "While the regulations technically capped residential security deposits at 2 months, enforcement is lacking. Most landlords and brokers in prime areas still successfully leverage high demand to enforce 5 to 10-month deposits under the table."

        category: "Housing & Infrastructure",
        question: "You're deciding between a standalone 1BHK in HSR Layout and one in a gated society. What's the hidden cost of the standalone building?",
        options: { "A": "Higher property tax", "B": "Paying for your own water tankers in summer", "C": "Required RWA membership fee", "D": "Higher security deposits" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Standalone buildings often rely entirely on borewells that dry up by March. In a society, tanker costs are averaged into maintenance, but in a standalone, you and your neighbors bear the brunt of private tanker pricing daily during peak summer."

        question: "What is the typical brokerage fee when securing an apartment in Bellandur?",
        options: { "A": "Half a month's rent", "B": "1 month's rent + 18% GST", "C": "Flat ₹5,000", "D": "Brokerage is illegal in Karnataka" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Brokers tightly control the Outer Ring Road (ORR) markets like Bellandur. The standard going rate is exactly one month's rent, and larger agencies will formally charge you 18% GST on top of it."
    },

        category: "The Domestic Help Economy",
        question: "What is the going rate for a part-time maid (cleaning + vessels, 1 hr/day) in a premium area like Indiranagar?",
        options: { "A": "₹1,000/month", "B": "₹2,500–3,500/month", "C": "₹5,000/month", "D": "₹8,000/month" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "For sweeping, swabbing, and washing vessels for a 1BHK, ₹2,500 to ₹3,500 is the standard rate set by domestic help networks in premium pin codes. Attempting to negotiate below ₹2,500 usually guarantees high turnover."

        question: "How much should you expect to pay a cook preparing 2 meals a day for one person?",

        correct: "B",
        explanation: "A reliable cook for a single person making two meals (typically breakfast and lunch cooked in the morning) charges between ₹5,000 and ₹8,000 depending on the complexity of the cuisine."

        question: "Which of the following describes the 'Deepavali Bonus' norm for domestic staff in Bangalore?",
        options: { "A": "A box of sweets only", "B": "Half a month's salary", "C": "One full month's extra salary", "D": "Not customary in Bangalore" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "The unspoken rule in Bangalore is one full month's salary as a festive bonus, usually given around Deepavali. Skipping or shortchanging this is the fastest way to lose reliable help without notice."

        category: "Food, Cafes & Nightlife",
        question: "You want a pint of house craft beer at Toit in Indiranagar. What's the approximate hit to your wallet (including taxes)?",
        options: { "A": "₹250", "B": "₹350", "C": "₹500", "D": "₹800" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "With Bangalore's soaring liquor taxes, a standard 500ml craft beer at an institution like Toit hovers around ₹450-₹550 with VAT and service charges included. The days of ₹250 craft beer are long gone."

        question: "What is the typical price (and time cost) of a ghee podi masala dosa at The Rameshwaram Cafe on a Saturday morning?",
        options: { "A": "₹80, 10 min wait", "B": "₹120, no wait", "C": "₹195, 45 min wait", "D": "₹350, 20 min wait" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "A ghee podi masala dosa runs about ₹195. The real cost, however, is the 40 to 60-minute wait in the queue just to place your order and secure a standing spot on the pavement."

        id: "blr_10",
        category: "Food, Cafes & Nightlife",
        question: "How much does a standard hot cappuccino cost at Third Wave Coffee Roasters, the staple tech-bro meeting spot?",
        options: { "A": "₹120", "B": "₹240", "C": "₹350", "D": "₹450" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Third Wave Coffee has effectively indexed Bangalore's startup meeting economy. A regular hot cappuccino costs around ₹209, pushing to ₹240+ after taxes. It's essentially the cover charge for table space and Wi-Fi."

        id: "blr_11",
        category: "Food, Cafes & Nightlife",
        question: "Where would you typically find the cheapest, most authentic 'Darshini' breakfast (Idli/Vada)?",
        options: { "A": "A standalone shop with no seating where you eat standing at high tables", "B": "A mall food court", "C": "A multi-cuisine fine dining restaurant", "D": "Only at railway stations" },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The 'Darshini' model—pay first, stand at steel tables, eat fast—is the backbone of Bangalore mornings. You can get a plate of idli-vada for under ₹60, served blisteringly fast."

        category: "Transport & Commute",
        question: "You live in Koramangala. You have a flight from Kempegowda International at 8 PM on a Tuesday. How much is an Uber realistically going to cost you during the evening rush hour?",
        options: { "A": "₹600", "B": "₹1,000", "C": "₹1,400", "D": "₹2,500" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "An Uber or Ola from South/Central Bangalore to the airport (40+ km away) has a base of about ₹1,000. During the evening peak surge—factoring in the ₹120 toll and recent airport pickup fee hikes—that number easily climbs to ₹1,200–₹1,400+."

    {
        id: "blr_13",
        category: "Transport & Commute",
        question: "Why have EV cab startups like Shoffr and BluSmart become the aggressive alternatives to Ola/Uber for airport drops?",
        options: { "A": "They fly you on a drone", "B": "Pure EV fleets with absolutely zero surge pricing and zero driver cancellations", "C": "They are subsidized by the government", "D": "They serve free breakfast in the cab" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Companies like Shoffr and BluSmart swallowed the premium airport market by offering scheduled, non-cancellable EV rides with fixed pricing. This completely eliminated the anxiety of a 4 AM Uber driver cancelling on you or demanding cash."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_14",
        category: "Transport & Commute",
        question: "You want to commute from HSR Layout to Whitefield using only Namma Metro. What is the fatal flaw with this plan in 2026?",
        options: { "A": "The metro doesn't stop at HSR Layout", "B": "It requires an absurd three-line detour (Yellow to Green to Purple) until the Blue Line is finished", "C": "The metro only runs until 7 PM", "D": "The trains do not allow laptops on board" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "While the long-awaited Yellow Line finally opened in 2025 (connecting HSR), reaching Whitefield (Purple Line) directly is impossible until the ORR Blue Line is completed. Right now, it requires taking the Yellow Line to RV Road, Green Line to Majestic, and Purple Line to Whitefield—an enormous detour."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_15",
        category: "Transport & Commute",
        question: "What is the standard rule for negotiating with a street-hailed auto rickshaw outside a tech park?",
        options: { "A": "They always use the meter perfectly", "B": "Quote half of what they ask and walk away", "C": "Expect to pay 'Meter + ₹50' or simply double the actual fare", "D": "Autos are banned near tech parks" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "The mechanical auto meter is largely decorative in prime areas. Drivers will either demand 'One and a half', a flat ₹150 for 2 kilometers, or refuse to take you entirely."

        id: "blr_16",
        category: "Utilities & Hidden Costs",
        question: "It's late April. You run a 1.5-ton AC in your 1BHK for 8 hours a night. What will your BESCOM electricity bill look like?",
        options: { "A": "₹500", "B": "₹1,200", "C": "₹3,500", "D": "₹6,000" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "BESCOM tariffs have seen recent hikes in fixed charges. Extended AC usage in the brief but brutal summer months (April/May) will easily push a single-person household's bill into the ₹3,000–₹4,500 territory."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_17",
        category: "Utilities & Hidden Costs",
        question: "What is the typical cost for a reliable 150Mbps fiber internet connection (ACT, Airtel, or Jio) per month?",
        options: { "A": "₹400", "B": "₹1,000", "C": "₹2,500", "D": "₹4,000" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Bangalore's internet infrastructure is excellent. Providers offer highly stable 150-200Mbps connections for roughly ₹800–1,100 per month."

        id: "blr_18",
        category: "Utilities & Hidden Costs",
        question: "What is 'BESCOM Tuesday' to a newcomer?",
        options: { "A": "A discount day for bills", "B": "The day electricity boards shut off power for unannounced 'maintenance'", "C": "A local festival", "D": "Free metro rides" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Power cuts for 'tree trimming and line maintenance' are notorious in older layouts, often swallowing entire weekday mornings. A good society with 100% DG (Diesel Generator) backup is mandatory, not a luxury."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_19",
        category: "Local Survival Skills",
        question: "A local speaks to you rapidly in Kannada and you don't understand. What is the most polite, useful phrase to deploy?",
        options: { "A": "Kannada theriyaadhu", "B": "Kannada gothilla", "C": "Mujhe hindi aati hai", "D": "Speak English please" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "'Kannada gothilla' (I don't know Kannada) is the baseline survival phrase. Saying 'theriyaadhu' (Tamil) will heavily annoy locals, and assuming everyone speaks Hindi will cause immediate friction."

        id: "blr_20",
        category: "Local Survival Skills",
        question: "You jump a red light at Sony World Signal. What is the official traffic challan amount?",
        options: { "A": "₹100", "B": "₹500", "C": "₹2,000", "D": "₹5,000" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Jumping a traffic signal carries an official fine of ₹500. Bangalore Traffic Police (BTP) use extensive camera networks, so you will often get the challan SMS before you even reach your destination."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_21",
        category: "Local Survival Skills",
        question: "If an auto driver keeps suggesting 'route change maadi' mid-trip, what are they actually saying?",
        options: { "A": "They want to show you a tourist spot", "B": "They are lost", "C": "Traffic on the main road is deadlocked, they want to take inner gullies", "D": "They want to drop you early" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "Google Maps rarely understands the chaotic reality of Bangalore bottlenecks as well as auto drivers do. To 'change route' usually means diving into impossibly narrow residential roads to bypass gridlock."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_22",
        category: "Local Survival Skills",
        question: "What does the phrase 'Swalpa adjust maadi' mean culturally?",

        correct: "B",
        explanation: "'Swalpa adjust maadi' is the city's unofficial motto. It's used when someone squeezes next to you on a bus, when a landlord delays fixing a tap, or when a deadline slips."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_23",
        category: "Housing & Infrastructure",
        question: "You are renting an apartment. Who is typically responsible for routine painting and deep cleaning before you move in according to Bangalore norms?",
        options: { "A": "The incoming tenant", "B": "The landlord, who deducts 1 month's rent from the PREVIOUS tenant for it", "C": "The broker", "D": "The society association" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Ah, the legendary 'painting charge'. Landlords will legally deduct one full month's rent from your security deposit when you leave, supposedly to paint and clean for the next person."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_24",
        category: "Transport & Commute",
        question: "You need groceries delivered in 10 minutes. Which app dominates this hyperlocal market in Bangalore?",
        options: { "A": "Amazon Fresh", "B": "BigBasket", "C": "Zepto / Swiggy Instamart / Blinkit", "D": "Flipkart Grocery" },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "Quick-commerce is a religion here. Zepto, Instamart, and Blinkit heavily dominate the market. Notably, Blinkit riders carry just one order at a time to guarantee those lightning-fast drops. Nobody in Koramangala or Indiranagar waits 24 hours for eggs anymore."
    },
    {
        id: "blr_25",
        category: "Utilities & Hidden Costs",
        question: "What is the standard BWSSB (water board) reality for most huge tech-park adjacent apartment complexes along the ORR?",
        options: { "A": "24/7 pristine government supply", "B": "They rely heavily on private water tankers due to lack of Cauvery water connection", "C": "They desalinate sea water", "D": "It's included completely free in property tax" },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Vast stretches of Outer Ring Road, Mahadevapura, and Bellandur do not have piped Cauvery water. Entire 1000-unit complexes run entirely on an army of private water tankers, making maintenance fees skyrocket in summer."
