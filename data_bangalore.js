                question: "You want a 1BHK in Koramangala 5th Block. What is the realistic minimum rent you should expect to pay in early 2026?",
                options: { "A": "₹15,000", "B": "₹22,000", "C": "₹32,000", "D": "₹45,000" },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "A 1BHK in Koramangala 5th Block typically runs ₹32,000–38,000 in 2026. The jump from 4th to 5th Block alone adds ₹4,000 to rent purely on perceived social cachet and proximity to cafes."

                options: { "A": "2 months rent", "B": "5 months rent", "C": "10 months rent", "D": "First and last month only" },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Bangalore is notorious for its rigid 10-month security deposit expectation. While some newer landlords running standalone buildings might accept 6 months, 10 is still the entrenched market standard for prime IT corridors."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Standalone buildings often rely entirely on borewells that dry up by March. In a society, tanker costs are averaged into maintenance, but in a standalone, you and your 3 neighbors split the ₹1,500 tanker cost daily during peak summer."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Brokers tightly control the Outer Ring Road (ORR) markets like Bellandur. The standard going rate is exactly one month's rent, and larger agencies will formally charge you 18% GST on top of it."

                explanation: "For just sweeping, swabbing, and washing vessels for a 1BHK, ₹2,500 to ₹3,500 is the standard cartel rate set by domestic help networks in premium pin codes. Don't try to negotiate below ₹2,500."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "A reliable cook for a single person making two meals (typically breakfast/lunch cooked in the morning) charges between ₹5,000 and ₹8,000 depending on the complexity of the food and whether it's North or South Indian cuisine."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "The unspoken rule in Bangalore is one full month's salary as a festive bonus, usually given around Deepavali. Skipping or shortchanging this is the fastest way to lose reliable help without notice."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "With Bangalore's soaring liquor taxes, a standard pint at an institution like Toit hovers around ₹450-₹550 with VAT and service charges included. The days of ₹250 craft beer are long gone."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "A ghee podi masala dosa runs about ₹180-220. The real cost is the 40 to 60-minute wait in the queue just to place your order and secure a standing spot on the pavement."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Third Wave Coffee has effectively indexed Bangalore's startup meeting economy. A standard cappuccino will cost you roughly ₹240 to ₹260 before taxes. It's the cover charge for table space."

                correct: "A",
                explanation: "The 'Darshini' model—pay first, stand at steel tables, eat fast—is the backbone of Bangalore mornings. You can get a plate of idli-vada for under ₹60, served blisteringly fast."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "An Uber or Ola from South/Central Bangalore to the airport (40+ km away) typically hits ₹800–₹1,000 with toll charges. During heavy rain or peak surge, that number easily crosses ₹1,400."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "BluSmart swallowed the airport market by offering scheduled, non-cancellable EV rides with fixed pricing (often around ₹600-₹700 from central areas), eliminating the anxiety of a 4 AM Uber driver cancelling on you."

                options: { "A": "The metro doesn't allow laptops", "B": "The metro only runs until 7 PM", "C": "There is a massive connectivity gap requiring a 5km auto ride on both ends", "D": "Fares are higher than an Uber" },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "While the Purple line reaches Whitefield, getting TO the metro station from areas like HSR requires fighting through Silk Board traffic in an auto, destroying any time savings the train offered."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "The mechanical auto meter is a decorative item in Bangalore. Drivers will either demand 'One and a half', a flat ₹150 for 2 kilometers, or refuse to take you entirely."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "BESCOM tariffs are steep. Extended AC usage in the brief but brutal summer months (April/May) will easily push a single-person household's bill into the ₹3,000–₹4,500 territory."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Power cuts for 'tree trimming and line maintenance' are notorious in older layouts, often swallowing entire weekday mornings. A good society with 100% DG (Diesel Generator) backup is not a luxury; it's mandatory."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "'Kannada gothilla' (I don't know Kannada) is the baseline survival phrase. Saying 'theriyaadhu' (Tamil) will aggressively annoy locals, and assuming everyone speaks Hindi will cause immediate friction."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Jumping a traffic signal carries an official fine of ₹500. Bangalore Traffic Police (BTP) use extensive camera networks, so you will often get the challan SMS before you reach your destination."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Google Maps rarely understands the chaotic reality of Bangalore bottlenecks as well as auto drivers do. To 'change route' usually means diving into impossibly narrow residential roads to bypass gridlock."
