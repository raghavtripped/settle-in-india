                question: "You want a 1BHK in Bandra West in early 2026. What is the realistic minimum rent bracket?",
                options: { "A": "₹30,000–45,000", "B": "₹55,000–80,000", "C": "₹80,000–1,10,000", "D": "₹20,000–35,000" },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Bandra West commands a massive premium. Even an older, smaller 1BHK will run you ₹55,000–₹80,000. For anything below ₹55,000, you are likely looking at a windowless room or moving further north to Andheri."

                question: "Mumbai is considered one of the most tenant-friendly metros when it comes to the security deposit. What is the norm?",
                options: { "A": "10 months rent", "B": "6 months rent", "C": "2–3 months rent", "D": "1 month rent" },
                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Unlike Bangalore's punishing 10-month norm, Mumbai landlords typically ask for only 2 to 3 months' rent as a deposit, making the initial cash layout much easier for newcomers despite the higher monthly rent."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Powai (Hiranandani Gardens specifically) is a meticulously planned township with wide roads, sidewalks, and reliable infrastructure. Andheri East, while better connected by rail/metro, is notoriously chaotic."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Monsoon flooding is a critical reality. Many low-lying areas (like parts of Milan Subway, Hindmata, or even certain Bandra pockets) disappear underwater during July's high tides coupled with heavy rain."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "In Maharashtra, residential tenancy agreements are usually executed as 'Leave and License' agreements for 11 months, which protects the landlord from rent control laws better than a formal lease."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Domestic help in Mumbai is highly unionized and transactional. You pay per 'kam' (job). Sweeping/swiping is one job, washing clothes is another, washing vessels is another. Each task adds ₹1,500 to ₹2,000 per month."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "A 'Maharaj' is a highly skilled freelance cook, often specializing in Gujarati, Marwari, or Jain food. They command top dollar to cook multiple meals for a few affluent households."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "A street-side Vada Pav remains the city's great equalizer at ₹15-₹20. A trendy cafe will deconstruct it, serve it with truffle fries, and charge ₹80-₹120 or more for the air conditioning."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Premium pubs maintain high prices. A pint of craft beer at established venues like Woodside Inn will cost between ₹450 and ₹600 without counting the service charge."

                correct: "C",
                explanation: "Mumbai never truly stops. You can find someone frying a fresh batch of Vada Pav or serving hot Pav Bhaji near major junctions like Dadar or Churchgate well past 1 AM."

                explanation: "A 'Fast' local skips lesser-used stations, drastically cutting commute times from distant suburbs like Borivali into Churchgate. Catching a 'Fast' during peak hours is a competitive sport."
