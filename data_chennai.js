                options: { "A": "₹12,000", "B": "₹22,000–35,000", "C": "₹50,000–65,000", "D": "₹6,000" },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Adyar and Besant Nagar (Elliots Beach) are premium, old-money, tree-lined neighborhoods. A decent 1BHK here will cost ₹22,000–35,000. Renting here also requires navigating strict landlords."

                correct: "A",
                explanation: "Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) is 'IT Highway'. Supply is massive, so a 1BHK in a sprawling society (with a gym and pool) is highly affordable at ₹16,000–24,000."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Chennai's airport is solidly within the city (Meenambakkam). A cab from central/western areas like Anna Nagar usually costs ₹400-₹600, much cheaper than Bangalore's airport run."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Chennai auto drivers are infamous. The meter is a myth. You must forcefully negotiate the fixed rate before sitting, or use Ola/Uber autos to retain your sanity."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Chennai has three seasons: Hot, Hotter, and Hottest (with cyclones). Extreme AC dependency during 'Agni Natchathiram' (peak summer) will blast your bi-monthly bill into the ₹3,000–6,000 realm."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Chennai frequently faces 'Day Zero' water crises. When the Poondi and Chembarambakkam lakes dry up, private tanker companies hold the city hostage, hiking prices massively."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "'Thambi' means younger brother in Tamil. The driver is buttering you up before giving you a completely unreasonable fixed fare."

                correct: "A",

                options: { "A": "It's illegal", "B": "Linguistic pride runs incredibly deep; assuming someone knows Hindi is heavily frowned upon. Start in English.", "C": "Hindi means 'anger' in Tamil", "D": "Nobody in Chennai travels" },
                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Tamil Nadu fought aggressively against Hindi imposition. Automatically defaulting to Hindi to a shopkeeper is seen as arrogant. Default to English or broken Tamil first."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Before the shiny modern Metro, Chennai had the MRTS (Mass Rapid Transit System). Its massive, shadowy, brutalist concrete stations look eerie, but it's cheap and dodges all city traffic."

                correct: "B",
                explanation: "Tamil Nadu controls alcohol tightly through TASMAC. Buying a bottle of rum means standing in a sweaty gridlock of humanity at a counter. 'Elite TASMAC' stores in malls are slightly better."
